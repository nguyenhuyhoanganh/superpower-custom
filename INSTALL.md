# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux (Windows symlinks need `mklink`; not supported in this version)
- Bash 4+
- Git
- Cline VSCode extension installed

## Install

The installer assumes this repo lives at `<workspace>/superpower-custom/`
where `<workspace>` is the VSCode workspace root that Cline reads.

```bash
cd <workspace>
./superpower-custom/install.sh
```

After install, the following symlinks exist:

```
<workspace>/.clinerules/00-bootstrap.md             → superpower-custom/rules/00-bootstrap.md
<workspace>/.clinerules/workflows/brainstorm.md     → superpower-custom/workflows/brainstorm.md
<workspace>/.clinerules/workflows/write-plan.md     → superpower-custom/workflows/write-plan.md
<workspace>/.clinerules/workflows/execute-plan.md   → superpower-custom/workflows/execute-plan.md
<workspace>/.cline/skills/<skill-name>              → superpower-custom/skills/<skill-name>/
                                                       (one symlink per skill, 13 total)
```

## Verify

```bash
./superpower-custom/verify-install.sh
```

Expected: `OK: 17 symlinks installed (1 rule + 3 workflows + 13 skills)`.

## Uninstall

```bash
./superpower-custom/uninstall.sh
```

Removes symlinks only. Source code in `superpower-custom/` is untouched.

## How updates work

Symlinks point at source files, so editing anything under `superpower-custom/`
takes effect the next time Cline reads the file. No re-install needed.

## Open Cline in this workspace

After install, restart your Cline VSCode session (or open the workspace
folder in VSCode). On the first turn Cline reads `.clinerules/00-bootstrap.md`
and loads `using-superpowers` via `use_skill`.
